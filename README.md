## Inspiration
Our inspiration came from a previous winner of another Washington hackathon, who created a game where players fed a monster different foods to keep it healthyâ€”teaching about the four food groups called the [monster meal](https://devpost.com/software/the-monster-s-meal). In a similar vain, our app is a game with the goal of educating people about what contributes to mental health and well-being.

## What it does

You have to balance different needs, like your physical and mental health. This teaches the user about keeping themselves healthy by making smart decisions.

## How we built it
We built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as used [framer](https://framer.com/) for the design.

## Challenges we ran into
Our biggest challenges came during the design phase, particularly in creating a clean and intuitive user interface. Initially, we relied heavily on [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), but as the project evolved, we transitioned to using standard CSS and eventually shifted to Figma as the primary tool for designing and refining our UI.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The biggest accomplishment was our state machine that we set in order to help update and track time in a realistic matter for our web app.

## What we learned
We gained a deeper understanding of how to make a [state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) in JavaScript to dynamically manage and update values. We also learned how to leverage Figma to enhance the visual design and user experience of our interface.

## What's next for Health Simulator 
Our goal is to continue improving Health Simulator and eventually develop it into a fully functional app that can be published on app stores.
